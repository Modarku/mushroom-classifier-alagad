# Mushroom Classifier

The Mushroom Classifier is a mobile-friendly deep learning application that identifies common mushroom genera from images. Built on an augmented MobileNetV3 architecture, the model was trained on the [maysee/mushrooms-classification-common-genuss-images dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maysee/mushrooms-classification-common-genuss-images), which contains thousands of labeled mushroom photos across common genera.

This application is simply an experiment to learn about image classification utilizing Keras and Tensorflow.
